# Machine learning

This space is created to consult and consume documents, codes and inputs that we use in the **_Machine Learning_** course that I have taught at the **_National Banking and Securities Commission_**, at the **_Faculty of Sciences_** and at the **_Anahuac University_**, the syllabus is shown below:

+ Regression models
+ Sorting algorithms
+ Grouping techniques
+ Association rules

Each of the modules is designed to address three main points:

+ Understand the idea of ​​each algorithm
+ Implement the algorithm in Python
+ Implement the algorithm in R

If you have any questions you can write to me privately at _lozas2605@gmail.com_, in the header of the email, state the topic.

Sincerely,
